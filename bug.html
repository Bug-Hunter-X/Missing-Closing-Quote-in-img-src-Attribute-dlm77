<p>This is a common error in HTML, but it can be easy to miss:</p> <p><code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description"&gt;</code></p> <p>The problem is that the <code>src</code> attribute is missing a closing quote.  While browsers often try to recover, this can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly if the filename contains spaces or special characters.   The browser may attempt to load the wrong resource or fail to load the image at all. In some cases, the missing quote may even cause the browser to treat the next piece of HTML as part of the file path.</p>
